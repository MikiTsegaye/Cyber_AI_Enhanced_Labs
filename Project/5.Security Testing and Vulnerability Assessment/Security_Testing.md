# 🛡️ Stage 6: Security Testing & Vulnerability Assessment
### Group 7 | NVIDIA Morpheus Spear Phishing Pipeline

This stage is the "Crash Test" for our AI. We throw different attacks at the model to see if it stays strong or if it breaks.

---

## 🧪 1. Testing Practical Attacks
We tested the system against the most common ways hackers try to break in.

### 📧 The Phishing Test (Social Engineering)
* **What we did**: We gave the AI nearly 30,000 "bad" emails to look at.
* **The Result**: The AI looked at the "Sexual Health" spam and gave it a high **MSE Score** of **0.002473**.
* **Why it passed**: Because the score was so high, the AI flagged it as an anomaly immediately.

### 🌊 The DoS Test (Traffic Flooding)
* **What we did**: We tried to overwhelm the system with over 400,000 emails at once.
* **The Secret Weapon**: We used the **NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU**.
* **Why it passed**: The GPU processed data at **13.36 items per second**. It was too fast for the "flooding" attack to freeze the computer.

## 🧬 2. Model Robustness (Sneaky Attacks)
We checked if a hacker could "trick" the AI by changing letters or words.

* **Typo Resistance**: We used **SBERT** which looks at the *meaning* of a sentence, not just the spelling.
* **Why it passed**: If a hacker writes "Ph1shing" instead of "Phishing," the SBERT model still understands the "vibe" is wrong and flags it.
* **Tuning Defense**: Our first model was too strict and missed attacks. We **tuned it to the 70th percentile**, which fixed this weakness and caught **9,536 more attacks**.



---

## 🔌 3. Inter-working (System Teamwork)
Does the AI play well with other security tools?

* **Brain Saving**: We saved our AI "brain" as a **`.pth` file** in the `models/` folder.
* **Why it passed**: This makes it easy to "plug" our AI into a bigger **NVIDIA Morpheus** pipeline or other security apps without having to train it again.

## 🚦 4. Final Security Scorecard

| Test Type | Result | How we won |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phishing** | ✅ PASS | High MSE scores for bad emails. |
| **Traffic Load** | ✅ PASS | RTX 3050 GPU was too fast to crash. |
| **Sneaky Typos** | ✅ PASS | SBERT understands meaning, not just letters. |
| **Teamwork** | ✅ PASS | Model is saved and ready to be used anywhere. |
