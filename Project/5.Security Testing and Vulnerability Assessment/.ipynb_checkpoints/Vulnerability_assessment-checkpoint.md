-# 🛡️ Stage 6: Security Testing & Vulnerability Assessment

This stage serves as the "adversarial stress test" for our AI guard. We used insights from our **EDA** to craft specific attacks to see if the model could be tricked.

## 🧪 1. Systematic Vulnerability Testing
We used the "Red Flag" patterns found in our EDA to test the model's logic.

### 📧 The "Fake Mustache" Test (Synonyms)
* **Attack**: Replacing "URGENT" with "Immediate".
* **Result**: The Alarm Level dropped from **0.001479** to **0.001463**.
* **Insight**: While the model is mostly robust, there is a minor vulnerability to semantic shifts where "softer" words lower the suspicion score.

### 🍪 The "Cookie" Trick (Benign Word Injection)
* **Attack**: Surrounding a phishing request with common business words (meeting, regards, report) identified in our EDA.
* **Result**: The Alarm Level plummeted to **0.000639** (a 56% drop).
* **Vulnerability**: **HIGH.** The model averages intent. Adding enough "good" words can successfully distract the AI from a threat.

## 🧬 2. Feature Robustness (Noise & Ablation)
We tested if the AI is a perfectionist or if it understands the "vibe" of a threat.

* **Typo Resistance**: We used "v3rify" and "acc0unt".
* **Result**: Alarm level increased to **0.001600**. 
* **Conclusion**: The guard is **Robust to Noise**. It treats "weird" text as an anomaly, which actually makes it harder to sneak past with typos.

### 🪓 Token Ablation (Word-by-Word Analysis)
| Word Removed | New Alarm Level | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *None* | 0.001479 | Base Level |
| **Please** | **0.001264** | **Safety Shield**: Removing this made the email look *more* dangerous. |
| **URGENT:** | 0.001697 | **Trigger**: Removing this confused the model's pattern. |

## 🚦 3. Realistic Deployment Simulation
We tested a "Bossy Boss" email to see if we get False Positives.

* **Scenario**: "I need that file for the meeting. Check the link."
* **Result**: **SUCCESS.** The guard did not flag the email.
* **Impact**: This shows the model is tuned well enough to allow high-pressure business communication without interrupting work.

## 🏁 Summary of Findings
1. **Critical Vulnerability**: Adversaries can bypass detection by "diluting" phishing intent with high-frequency benign business tokens.
2. **Key Strength**: The model is highly resistant to character-level noise (typos).
3. **Explainability**: Using ablation, we proved that polite language (e.g., "Please") acts as a statistical "camouflage" for malicious intent in this model.
